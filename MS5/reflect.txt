-----------------------------------------------------------
I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code
that my professor provided to complete my project milestones.

// Part 1
For this milestone, I would just say that I realized that even though the code worked on the workshop it was meant for. When it came time to combining the code, I found that it did not interact the way it wanted. 

// Part 2
I thought this part was quite straight forward, I did not have much trouble implementing this function.

// Part 3
For this part of the milestone, I found the illustration to be difficult to understand but I understood what it was trying to convey at the end. The tip about changing listItems to take a bool was a good advice in making my code have less repetitive code.

// Part 4
This one was pretty similar to the implementation to part 3, so pretty easy to do.

// Part 5
ITS DONE, I mostly had formatting errors while doing this part and a few invalid reads when I tried to call some of the functions wrong.
